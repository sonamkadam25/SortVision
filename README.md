## 2️⃣ Algorithms Included

| Algorithm | Best Case | Average Case | Worst Case | Space Complexity |
|------------|------------|---------------|--------------|------------------|
| Bubble Sort | Ω(n) | Θ(n²) | O(n²) | O(1) |
| Selection Sort | Ω(n²) | Θ(n²) | O(n²) | O(1) |
| Insertion Sort | Ω(n) | Θ(n²) | O(n²) | O(1) |
| Merge Sort | Ω(n log n) | Θ(n log n) | O(n log n) | O(n) |
| Quick Sort | Ω(n log n) | Θ(n log n) | O(n²) | O(log n) |
| Heap Sort | Ω(n log n) | Θ(n log n) | O(n log n) | O(1) |

## 3️⃣ Color-Coded Visualization

Each color represents a specific step in the sorting process:

🟦 Blue: Default state of the elements

🟨 Yellow: Elements currently being compared

🟥 Red: Elements identified in the wrong position and about to be moved

🟩 Green: Elements placed in the correct position

## 4️⃣ Learning Outcomes

- Visual understanding of how different sorting algorithms operate  
- Comparative analysis of algorithm efficiency  
- Enhanced understanding of **Big O notation** and algorithmic complexity
