✨ Features
🎨 Color-Coded Visualization

Each color represents a specific step in the sorting process:

🟦 Blue: Default state of the elements

🟨 Yellow: Elements currently being compared

🟥 Red: Elements identified in the wrong position and about to be moved

🟩 Green: Elements placed in the correct position
